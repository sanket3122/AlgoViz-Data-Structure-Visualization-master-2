# ALGOVIZ - Data Structures & Algorithms Visualizer 

• Built a full-stack DSA visualizer (Node.js/Express, MongoDB, JS/HTML/CSS) with auth/sessions, custom inputs, and
speed/step controls, animating stacks, queues, sorting and searching (binary/linear) algorithms.

• Designed an event-driven algorithm engine that emits step snapshots for smooth animations with pseudocode
highlighting, and operation/complexity counters, plus REST endpoints and saved replay sessions.
